Mysterious cache of jewels turns up atop French glacier - CNN.com EDITION: ?INTERNATIONAL U.S. M?XICO ARABIC TV : ? CNNi CNN en Espa?ol Set edition preference Sign up Log in Home Video World U.S. Africa Asia Europe Latin America Middle East Business World Sport Entertainment Tech Travel iReport SHARE THIS Print Email More sharing Reddit StumbleUpon Delicious Mysterious cache of jewels turns up atop French glacier By Michael Pearson and Saskya Vandoorne , CNN September 26, 2013 -- Updated 1834 GMT (0234 HKT) The jewels may be from the 1950 crash of an Air India flight that smashed into Mont Blanc during a storm, killing all 48 aboard. STORY HIGHLIGHTS A mountaineer discovers jewels on French glacier They could be from one of two airliners that crashed near the spot, one in 1950, the other 1966 French authorities are trying to trace the owners (CNN) -- It reads like the opening scene of an "Indiana Jones" movie. A young man climbing a French glacier finds a cache of glittering jewels wrapped in bags stamped "Made in India" -- remnants, perhaps, of cargo from an ill-fated airliner called the Malabar Princess. The best thing about it? This story is true. It happened early this month on a glacier overlooking the southeastern French village of Chamonix, Albertville police Chief Sylvain Merly said Thursday. Last year, alpinists found this diplomatic bag on Mont Blanc, believed to be from a 1966 Air India crash. The climber -- who Merly said asked to remain anonymous -- found the jewels inside a metal box atop the glacier. He turned them over to police in Bourg-Saint-Maurice on September 9. Merly declined to characterize the stones, which are being described in French media as rubies, sapphires and emeralds. They're worth somewhere between ?130,000 (about $175,000) and ?246,000 ($331,600), Merly said. French authorities are trying to trace ownership of the jewels. If proof of ownership can't be established, the unnamed 20-something mountaineer could stand to receive a portion of their value, Merly said. TrowelBlazers: In search of the female Indiana Jones The gems may be from the 1950 crash of Air India Flight 245, the "Malabar Princess." The plane smashed into nearby Mont Blanc during a storm, killing all 48 aboard. When it crashed, the plane was preparing to make a stop in Geneva, Switzerland, as it flew between Bombay -- now Mumbai -- and London. French authorities say it's also possible the gems could have been aboard an Air India Boeing 707, the "Kanchenjunga," that crashed in nearly the same spot 16 years later. A diplomatic bag from that flight was recovered last year. Adding a bit of intrigue to the story, the 1966 crash is the subject of scattered conspiracy theories suggesting the Air India flight, which carried the father of India's nuclear industry, Homi Bhabha, was shot down by a fighter jet or missile. Debris from the wrecks routinely emerges from the bottom of the glacier, including metal, wire and even a piece of landing gear discovered in 1986, according to a Mont Blanc tourist site.

Saudi cleric warns driving could damage women's ovaries - CNN.com EDITION: ?INTERNATIONAL U.S. M?XICO ARABIC TV : ? CNNi CNN en Espa?ol Set edition preference Sign up Log in Home Video World U.S. Africa Asia Europe Latin America Middle East Business World Sport Entertainment Tech Travel iReport SHARE THIS Print Email More sharing Reddit StumbleUpon Delicious Saudi cleric warns driving could damage women's ovaries By Mohammed Jamjoom, CNN September 30, 2013 -- Updated 0049 GMT (0849 HKT) SInce June 2011, dozens of women across Saudi Arabia have participated in the "Women2Drive" campaign. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Saudi cleric claims that driving affects "a woman's ovaries and that it pushes the pelvis upward" Religious leader was responding to a campaign encouraging women to defy the driving ban Women's rights activists, social media take soundly reject cleric's comments A petition calls for women in the kingdom to drive on October 26 (CNN) -- A leading Saudi cleric warned women who drive cars could cause damage to their ovaries and pelvises and that they are at risk of having children born with "clinical problems." Sheikh Saleh Al-Loheidan's widely derided remarks have gone viral as activists claim a website urging women to defy their country's driving ban has been blocked in Saudi Arabia. "If a woman drives a car," Al-Loheidan told Saudi news website sabq.org in an interview, "it could have a negative physiological impact ... Medical studies show that it would automatically affect a woman's ovaries and that it pushes the pelvis upward." Explained Al-Loheidan, "We find that for women who continuously drive cars, their children are born with varying degrees of clinical problems." The controversial comments, published Friday, were widely interpreted throughout Saudi Arabia as an attempt to discourage women in the country from joining a popular online movement urging them to stage a demonstration by driving cars on October 26. "This is his answer to the campaign," Saudi women's rights activist Aziza Yousef told CNN. "But it is an individual opinion. The clerical establishment is not behind this." Added Yousef: "He's making a fool of himself. He shouldn't touch this field at all -- the medical field is not his field at all." Mai Al-Swayan, who was one of the first Saudi women to sign the online petition, called the comments "ridiculous: " and added, "I am really disappointed. How could somebody ever make such a statement?" Al-Loheidan's words have been ridiculed mercilessly via social media since they were first reported. An Arabic Twitter hashtag called "#WomensDrivingAffectsOvariesAndPelvises" was quickly created to make fun of Al-Loheidan -- underscoring just how widely the call for Saudi women to defy the driving ban has resonated thus far. And while numerous conservative voices have supported Al-Loheidan, many Saudis believe this was an extremely clumsy way of trying to counter the popularity of the October 26 campaign. "I don't think it will harm the campaign -- on the contrary, it will make it stronger," said Saudi columnist and author Abdullah Al-Alami. Since it published online over a week ago, a petition on the website www.oct26driving.com has garnered more than 12,000 signatures from those asking authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to lift a de facto ban than prohibits women from driving. "There is no justification for the Saudi government to prohibit adult women citizens who are capable of driving cars from doing so," reads part of the petition. No traffic law specifically prohibits women from driving in Saudi Arabia, but religious edicts there are often interpreted to mean women are not allowed to operate a vehicle. The new petition also urges the Saudi government to present "to the citizens a valid and legal justification" for the ban, demanding authorities should not simply blame it on "societal consensus." Many supporters of the campaign expressed dismay when reporting the website could no longer be accessed throughout the Kingdom as of Saturday. A post on the Oct26driving.com website read, "Society wanting the ban to be lifted is apparently such a threat that the page petitioning the government to lift the ban has been blocked from within Saudi." Al Alami wondered if the numerous conservatives opposed to women being granted the right to drive may have asked for the site to be blocked. Still, Al-Alami said he isn't too concerned. "The message has been delivered," said Al-Alami. "This is a battle we must fight. There is no U-turn." CNN was unable to reach various Saudi Ministries for comment. The issue of women driving in the conservative kingdom has long been a contentious one. And while such demonstrations are extremely rare, they have been staged at least twice before. In June 2011, dozens of women across Saudi Arabia participated in the "Women2Drive" campaign by driving throughout the streets of their cities. In 1991, a group of 47 women drove through the country's capital city, Riyadh. After being arrested, many were further punished by being banned from travel and suspended from their workplaces. In addition to prohibiting driving, the country's strict and compulsory guardianship system also prevents women from opening bank accounts, working, traveling and going to school without the express permission of their male guardian. Saudi Arabia has been moving toward change under its current ruler, King Abdullah, who is considered a cautious reformer and proponent of women's rights. In January, he appointed 30 women to the Shura Council, the first time women had been chosen for the country's top consultative body. In 2011, he announced that women can run for office and vote in local elections in 2015, and in 2009, he appointed Saudi Arabia's first female deputy minister. 0 Comments ?

Jellyfish prompt nuclear reactor shutdown in Sweden - CNN.com EDITION: ?INTERNATIONAL U.S. M?XICO ARABIC TV : ? CNNi CNN en Espa?ol Set edition preference Sign up Log in Home Video World U.S. Africa Asia Europe Latin America Middle East Business World Sport Entertainment Tech Travel iReport SHARE THIS Print Email More sharing Reddit StumbleUpon Delicious Jellyfish prompt nuclear shutdown By Eliott C. McLaughlin , CNN October 3, 2013 -- Updated 1647 GMT (0047 HKT) It was spineless jellyfish, not politicians, that caused the shutdown in Sweden. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Jellyfish in a cooling-water intake prompted reactor shutdown, company says The reactor is now operational again, according to numerous media outlets The Oskarshamn nuclear plant generates about 10% of Sweden's electricity (CNN) -- There's been another shutdown, but instead of spineless politicians, you can blame invertebrate sea creatures. A large amount of jellyfish inhabiting a cooling-water intake at a major Swedish nuclear plant caused operators to manually shut down production at its largest reactor this week, according to OKG, the company that runs the plant. "The operations management at unit O3 chose to disconnect the facility from the grid at noon on Sunday due to a large amount of jellyfish present at the cooling water intake," an OKG statement said. "This decision is a preventive safety measure in order for the unit to not be automatically shut down due to too-low cooling in the condenser." OKG did not immediately return CNN calls seeking comment, but numerous media outlets reported that Oskarhamn Unit 3 was back up and running Wednesday. Robotic jellyfish may be underwater spy "Furthermore we have reinforced our clearing system to deal with any future jellyfish invasions," the outlets quoted OKG as saying in a statement. The company noted that the cooling water was used to cool steam before it went into the reactor, and the "water has no connection to the cooling of the reactor vessel." The plant, located 19 miles north of Oskarshamn on the southeast Baltic coast, is Sweden's first commercial nuclear plant , commissioned in 1972, and the third reactor went into operation in 1985. It has an output capacity of 1,450 megawatts. The plant's three reactors account for 10% of Sweden's electricity generation, OKG says. This isn't the first time the gelatinous creatures have caused problems at a power facility. Since 1999, jellyfish have threatened plants in the Philippines, Japan, Israel , the United States and Scotland , according to media reports. Robotic jellyfish could be undersea spy CNN's Peter Burn contributed to this report. 0 Comments ?

The WHO says more than 50% of hospitals have been damaged or are non-operational. (CNN) -- The ongoing violence in Syria has left millions of people displaced. And while many Syrians fled to neighboring countries to escape the bloodshed, others have remained despite being in harm's way, though they have been forced from their homes. According to the United Nations (U.N), an estimated 4.25 million people are homeless inside the country -- half of whom are believed to be children. Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children have been left vulnerable after being forced to relocate from their homes, often multiple times. Without adequate shelter, food and medical care, many people are now heavily relying on aid agencies to provide basic amenities. The family of Ayesha (not her real name) is among them. Syrian hospitals must operate secretly Syrians desperate for food as war rages The U.N. estimates 4.25 million people are homeless inside Syria. This 4-year-old girl carries a physical scar of the ongoing conflict -- after being burned during shelling. The girl's grandmother (pictured) says she fled her hometown in northern Syria after a bomb destroyed her home, killing two of her teenage children. Syria's medical system has suffered a heavy blow in the conflict. Without adequate shelter, food and medical care, many people are now heavily relying on aid agencies to provide basic amenities. Regardless of the dangers of operating in the middle of a battlefield, several NGOs are trying to establish medical care, with some hospitals even operated secretly. This four-year-old boy suffered from burns in an attack. "He was burned while he was at the house, they bombed the house, which collapsed on him, and there is no available treatment for him," his mother says. The WHO says more than 50% of hospitals have been damaged or are non-operational. Doctor Mohammed Abdul Salam, a pediatrician and medical director of a children's clinic run by the charity says: "There were no incubators in areas outside the government's control for premature babies.

She now lives in an abandoned building site with her remaining children and grandchildren and she fears for her family's safety, which is why she has asked not to use her real name. Her four-year-old granddaughter carries a physical scar of the ongoing conflict -- after being burned during shelling. Recalling the days she lived in her own house and farmland, Ayesha says: "You have five people being killed, at times six or 10 and 15. Every day they targeted us with bombs, missiles and snipers." Prison inmates suffer the most in Syria Ayesha is one among the 6.8 million people the U.N. deems to be in urgent need of protection and assistance. The destruction of homes and land has forced many others to abandon their old lives. Zenat (not her real name), a young mother, says she fled after her house was bombed. Her four-year-old son suffers from burns from that day. "He was burned while he was at the house, they bombed the house, which collapsed on him, and there is no available treatment for him," she says. Syria's medical system has suffered a heavy blow in this nearly three-year-old conflict. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 50% of Syrian hospitals have been destroyed or are non-operational. 7-year-old's story shows pain, worry of Syrian refugees That means, for a mother like Zenat, immediate medical care is unavailable even in dire situations. "We did not get any help, there are no doctors, where shall we take him? My heart burned where I saw him this way, it was very hard feeling for me," she recalls. According to data given to the WHO by Syrian health authorities, as of July 2013, 60% of the 91 public hospitals across the country have been affected by the conflict. Of those, 20 have been damaged, and 35 are out of service. Many Syrian doctors have also fled the country and for aid agencies trying to provide medical relief to the needy, Syria remains one of the most dangerous places to work. Some of the heavily damaged towns in Syria have even less access to healthcare. Syria's health ministry estimates that in the governorates of Deir-ez-Zo, Idleb and Aleppo, 70% of health centers are either damaged or out of service, the WHO said. World Food Programme beefing up its Syria program Aid needed Syrian children suffering malnutrition Thousands of children dying in Syria The United Nations Security Council is trying to ensure aid reaches those suffering inside Syria -- calling on the government to allow cross-border deliveries and on all combatants to agree on humanitarian pauses in fighting for aid convoys. Regardless of the dangers of operating in the middle of a battlefield, several Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are trying to establish medical care, with some hospitals even operated secretly. British-Syrian run charity Hand in Hand for Syria is one of them. It helps operates 37 clinics and hospitals within Syria, supported largely by donated medical supplies and volunteer doctors. In a makeshift clinic in Idleb province, Doctor Mohammed Abdul Salam, a pediatrician and medical director of a children's clinic run by the charity says: "There were no incubators in areas outside the government's control for premature babies. "In besieged areas, private hospitals used to charge high prices and people could not afford the costs of care, and that's why there was high infant mortality." The U.N. body for assistance in Syria -- the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs -- estimates that for 2013 alone aid of $1.4 billion is needed to deal with the growing humanitarian crisis inside the country. Destabilization of Syria's population will have an impact for many, many years to come. But for now, immediate assistance is needed for millions living under dire conditions.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS Keepers "heartbroken" as tiger cub found dead in enclosure at London Zoo Newborn animal believed to have drowned in pond after mother carried it outside Three-week-old cub was first Sumatran tiger to be born at zoo in 17 years London (CNN) -- Keepers at London Zoo are "distraught" after a newborn tiger cub -- the first Sumatran tiger born there for 17 years -- drowned in a pool at its enclosure. The animal was born to five-year-old first-time-mom Melati just three weeks ago, and its arrival was greeted with huge excitement and celebration at the zoo, where experts were "over-the-moon" about the birth. But on Saturday, keepers raised the alarm when they could no longer see the young tiger on cameras inside its den; a search of the enclosure revealed the animal's body. It is thought Melati carried the cub out into the paddock area of the zoo's "Tiger Territory," where it fell into the pond and drowned. Meet the newest resident at London Zoo Animals weighing in at London Zoo Wanted: Female for last surviving fish "We're heartbroken by what's happened," said London Zoo's Malcolm Fitzpatrick. Melati is said to be a very nervous tiger who prefers routine, and experts at the zoo had opted to allow her full access to the whole enclosure fearing that any changes to her environment might cause her to injure or abandon her cub. "At the time we thought it was in the best interests of Melati and her cub to allow her continued access to the full enclosure as normal," Fitzpatrick said. "We didn't want to put her on edge by changing her surroundings or routines, in case she abandoned or attacked the cub." London Zoo is to carry out a full review of the circumstances which led to the cub's death. "We would do anything to turn back the clock, and nobody could be more upset about what's happened than the keepers who work with the tigers every day," said Fitzpatrick. They are devoted to those tigers and are distraught." The zoo had kept Melati's pregnancy a secret for about 105 days before her cub was born on September 22. Hidden cameras were installed in her enclosure to keep watch over her throughout, and the speedy birth, which lasted just six minutes, was also caught on video. 0 Comments ?

The price -- 1.1 million British pounds, when adding the buyer's premium and tax -- is by far the highest ever fetched for memorabilia tied to the sunken passenger ship, according to veteran collector Craig Sopin. "This figure is going to be hard to beat," said Sopin, who helped authenticate the fact the violin came from the Titanic . "I can't think of anything else that is more iconic to come off that ship." According to survivors, Wallace Hartley's band played to calm passengers even as the ship sank beneath them. Jesse Owens' 1936 gold medal sold for $1,466,574 at auction on Sunday, December 8, setting a record for the highest price paid for Olympic memorabilia. This medal is considered one of the most important in Olympics history and is one of four Owens won at the 1936 games in Berlin, spoiling Adolf Hitler's planned showcase of Aryan superiority. Norman Rockwell's painting "Saying Grace" sold for $46 million on Wednesday, December 4, at Sotheby's American Art auction. It was a record for works by the late artist and for a single American painting. The illustration originally appeared on the Thanksgiving issue cover of The Saturday Evening Post in 1951. For the first time since 1947, and only the second time since the 19th century, a copy of the first book printed in America will be sold at auction. The Whole Book of Psalmes -- universally known as The Bay Psalm Book -- was produced in the virtual wilderness of Massachusetts Bay Colony by the Congregationalist Puritans. Titanic band leader Wallace Hartley's violin sold for $1.7 million at Henry Aldridge and Son Auctioneers in Devizes, England, on Saturday, October 19. The sale price was far higher than expected. An engraving from Wallace Hartley's fiance, Maria Robinson, is attached to the Titanic band leader's violin. This 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 recently sold at auction for $30 million in England. It was part of a group of race cars that won nine of 12 Forrmula 1 World Championship-qualifying races during 1954 and 1955 and was driven by Juan Manuel Fangio. The October yearlings sale at Tattersalls auction house in England saw a number of auction records broken in brisk trade. A 118-carat white diamond is on display at Sotheby's, a New York auction house, on September 4. The oval stone was auctioned off in Hong Kong on October 7 for a record $30.6 million.

Hartley's body was reportedly pulled from the water days after the April 1912 sinking with his violin case still strapped to his back. In 2006, the damaged violin was found in the attic of a home in Britain. It was authenticated through testing of salt water deposits, according to a statement released by Henry Aldridge and Son, which hosted the auction in Wiltshire, England. The violin was adorned with an engraved silver plate that connected it to Hartley. Aussie tycoon insists Titanic II good idea The names of the seller and the buyer have not been released. The famous wreckage was first discovered in 1985 off the coast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Since then there have been a number of research and recovery expeditions, during which time the artifacts included in the sale were found. Interest in the shipwreck peaked again after the release of the movie "Titanic" in 1997. The film grossed $1.8 billion worldwide, making it the second highest grossing film in history, according to Box Office Mojo, a site that tracks ticket sales. Over the years, exhibitions of Titanic artifacts have made millions, and auctions have drawn high-priced sales. End of an era for tourist trips to ghostly wreck of Titanic In 2004, Guernsey's auctioned off memorabilia from the Titanic and a few artifacts that had been passed down through the families of survivors. An original menu sold for about $100,000, the president of the auction house said at the time. Sopin, a Philadelphia lawyer who has between 300 or 400 Titanic artifacts, said the ocean liner's sinking is "in a class all its own" when it comes to disasters, due to its unique mix of historical, cultural and cinematic elements. "The ship is a microcosm of society," he said, noting the different classes of people aboard the ship that fateful night. And it had both villains and heroes -- Hartley and his fellow band members, none of whom survived, chief among the latter group. "What they were doing was actually causing a sense of calm on that ship," Sopin said. "You could only wonder the mass pandemonium that would have occurred otherwise. It helped save a lot of lives."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS European bison have been successfully reintroduced to Poland Animal was declared extinct in the country in the 1920s Around 1,200 animals are closely monitored by conservation groups Controlling population is now an issue with hunting a controversial proposal Editor's note: CNN's On the Road series brings you a greater insight into the customs and culture of Poland. On TV and online CNN explores the places, the people and the passions unique to this eastern European nation. Watch the episodes during the week of November 18 and the special half-hour show on November 23 & 24. (CNN) -- As a group of tourists was passing through the villages of Lesna and Zabrody in the north east of Poland last month, they caught glimpse of something that immediately sent them reaching for their cameras. Strolling through the meadows near the densely forested Bialowieza National Park were three magnificent European bison, standing up to two meters high and weighing up to 1,000 kilograms each. It was a doubly gratifying sight for Rafal Kowalczyk, a conservationist and the Director of the Mammal Research Institute at the Polish Academy of Sciences , who enjoyed seeing the tourists as much as the bison. Europe's largest land mammal had been declared extinct in the wild at the end of the 1920s, but after spirited and careful re-introduction efforts throughout the past 60 years, descendants of a small captive herd have gradually reassumed their position among Poland's vibrant indigenous fauna. This is a unique animal and a kind of relic of the past; there are fewer European bison than the black rhino in Africa. Rafal Kowalczyk The tourists, meanwhile, were training only their lenses on the animals and not the viewfinders of a shotgun, proving to Kowalczyk that the creatures could bring visitors to Poland for reasons other than to hunt them. "It really increases the touristic attraction of the area," said Kowalczyk, who co-ordinated one of several bison conservation programs between 2006 and 2010. "This is a unique animal, a kind of relic of the past because most of these large herbivores have become extinct. There are fewer European bison than the black rhino in Africa, for example." Back from the brin k European bison, also known as "wisent", roamed freely across the continent until the early 20th century, when a combination of factors including a shrinking habitat and poaching left only 54 individuals in captivity, according to a recent report commissioned by the Rewilding Europe initiative . But since 1959 small populations have been introduced in Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia, but most successfully in Poland where there are now 1,299 closely monitored, free-roaming individuals in small herds. The European bison spent several years classified as "endangered" on the Red List of Threatened Species published by the International Union of the Conservation of Nature. But recent population trends have increased annually by around 15%, earning the bison an upgrade to "vulnerable". The animal is far from out of the woods yet, but there is reason for cautious optimism. About 70% of money that goes into wildlife conservation nowadays comes from hunting and fishing. Bob Kern, President of the Hunting Consortium Conservationists regard bison as a so-called "umbrella species", whose well-being also tends to ensure a positive habitat for many other treasured creatures including moose, wolf and lynx, plus various bird and insect species. READ MORE: Poland's little-known heritage sites In attempts to broaden the genetic diversity among bison --all of Poland's bison descend from those 54 captive animals that survived "extinction" -- scientists have created migration channels to facilitate the interbreeding of herds. Locals residents have also been educated about the animals habits and the perceived damage caused by the bison to young trees, or when they stray into agricultural land. The principal concerns now are centered on controlling the bison population, ensuring herds do not become too large for the areas of land they occupy. Natural mortality among bison is low and the space they demand vast; five bison per 1,000 hectares of land is deemed the optimal density. Some culling of old, sick or unusually aggressive creatures has therefore become necessary, but the process is controversial, particularly since the Polish Ministry of the Environment has recently allowed commercial hunters to take part. Hunting as a conservation measure? Bison is not a game animal in Poland, meaning specific permission must be sought in order to kill one. But a small number of permits are now being issued annually to commercial agencies, providing the chance for hunters from anywhere in the world to add this rare beast to their trophy collections at a cost of up to $30,000 per animal. "Rather than have him (a bison selected to be culled) killed in a fight or smashed through a fence and injured, they simply allow him to be hunted," said Bob Kern, President and Founder of the Hunting Consortium, who arranges overseas trips for hunters from the company headquarters in Virginia. "That brings money into the reserve and into the conservation system and it prevents wanton waste." Kern added: "About 70% of money that goes into wildlife conservation nowadays comes from the sustainable use community. That means hunters and fishermen." Dr Wanda Olech-Piasecka, of the Warsaw University of Life Sciences, is a member of a commission -- alongside veterinarians, ecologists and scientists -- that discusses the number of hunting permits to issue each year and decides on the individual bison to be removed. She said that the process is strictly regulated, with a hunter being escorted by a forest ranger, pointed to the one animal he is allowed to shoot and only permitted to fire when it is alone. "Everything is organized," said Olech-Piasecka. "This kind of hunting involves 20, maybe 25 animals per year in Poland." But Kowalczyk does not believe that the animals are plentiful enough in Poland for even this carefully regulated hunting to take place. "This culling or hunting is occurring in some populations that number below 100 individuals," he said. He suggests that the bison might be better suited to life on the plains and out of the forests, which would not place an artificial limit on population numbers. "There is huge potential for bison increase in many areas and I'm quite sure that culling or hunting is not a good way to mitigate conflicts." 0 Comments ?

Pakistani teen Malala receives prize for bravery against Taliban - CNN.com EDITION: ?INTERNATIONAL U.S. M?XICO ARABIC TV : ? CNNi CNN en Espa?ol Set edition preference Sign up Log in Home Video World U.S. Africa Asia Europe Latin America Middle East Business World Sport Entertainment Tech Travel iReport SHARE THIS Print Email More sharing Reddit StumbleUpon Delicious Pakistani activist Malala given Sakharov Prize for bravery against Taliban By Ben Brumfield, CNN November 20, 2013 -- Updated 1325 GMT (2125 HKT) Malala Yousafzai with European Parliament president Martin Schulz, on November 20, 2013 in Strasbourg, France. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The teen activist survived a Taliban assassination attempt The prize has a cash award equivalent to about $67,000 Malala turned her acceptance speech into a plea for help for children everywhere The EU parliament's president also heaped praise on her father for encouraging her (CNN) -- It's easy to guess what Malala Yousafzai would do with roughly $67,000. Spend it to educate children, particularly girls in her native Pakistan, she has said in the past. But it wasn't about the money when the 16-year-old, who survived a Taliban assassination attempt for her activism, picked up the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought from the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, on Wednesday. She tried not to make the occasion about herself, after accepting the blue framed plaque and walking up to the microphone in high heels. She had worn them to be seen over the podium, she explained to the audience. Instead, Malala turned her acceptance speech into a plea on behalf of nearly 60 million children around the world, who can't go to school. Starving children, who live in fear. Children who dodge bullets and bombs. Girls whose families lock them away from the world inside their homes. New Taliban leader tried to kill Malala FULL Amanpour Malala Interview Who is Malala Yousafzai? "This must shake our conscience," she admonished parliamentarians gathered to celebrate her win. She told them that she hoped those in the West would see beyond their own borders to help them. She pleaded specifically for help in her own country. She told them that the prize would encourage her to keep standing up against the Pakistan Taliban for the sake of education and would continue her work. "Because of terrorism, hundreds of schools have been destroyed," she said. Making an impression To the crowd, which included 22 former prize winners, the ceremony, which took place on World Children's Day, was very much about Malala. They gave her a standing ovation. The teen, who still contends with nerve damage caused by a Taliban bullet, has impressed leaders in the parliament's chambers and around the world with her "incredible strength," as Parliament President Martin Schulz put it when first announcing that she had won the award on October 10. The date was laden with symbolism. A year and a day before, she had faced down almost certain death to stand up for a girl's right to go to school, when a Pakistan Taliban gunman fired at her nearly point blank as she rode home from school on an improvised bus. It nearly killed her. Doctors in Pakistan scrambled to save her life -- as her brain swelled -- before flying her to the UK, where a medical team worked on her recovery. Malala is used to making public speeches on bravery and education. Her first, in September 2008, was titled "How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to an education?" the EU parliament said. In 2009, the Taliban banned girls from schools in Swat Valley, which she called home. She anonymously blogged for the BBC in opposition to that order and became an open advocate for girls' education. In 2011, Malala told CNN, "I have the right of education. I have the right to play. I have the right to sing. I have the right to talk." Shared praise Malala's father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, sat silently next to her while Schulz, of Germany, heaped praise upon her. While he listened to the translation from German into English through an earphone, Schulz singled him out. Malala would not be who she is without her father, he said. "Your father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, is a teacher," he said. "He has expressed his views that boys and girls are equal." He encouraged her to blog and give interviews to the media, to protest against the Taliban, Schulz pointed out. "Malala, I'm sure you are as proud of your father as he is of you," he said. While applauding her bravery in the face of an assignation attempt, Schulz reminded the audience that Malala has said that this is not what she wants to be remembered for. She wants to be known as a girl who fought oppression to build education for all. READ: Malala spurs school-for-all vow, now deliver READ: Why Malala's bravery inspires us 0 Comments ?

France to send 1,000 more troops to Central African Republic - CNN.com EDITION: ?INTERNATIONAL U.S. M?XICO ARABIC TV : ? CNNi CNN en Espa?ol Set edition preference Sign up Log in Home Video World U.S. Africa Asia Europe Latin America Middle East Business World Sport Entertainment Tech Travel iReport SHARE THIS Print Email More sharing Reddit StumbleUpon Delicious France to send 1,000 more troops to Central African Republic By Laura Smith-Spark and Marie-Louise Gumuchian, CNN November 26, 2013 -- Updated 1812 GMT (0212 HKT) A woman and children are shown at a camp for internally displaced people in the Central African Republic on November 9. STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: Doctors Without Borders highlights plight of the many people displaced by violence Mission is expected to last about six months, Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian says About 400 French troops are already deployed in the African nation A transitional government has been in place since a coup earlier this year (CNN) -- France will send approximately 1,000 more troops to the Central African Republic, French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Tuesday in a radio interview. Speaking on Europe 1 radio, he said the mission would last about six months and would be coordinated with the United Nations and African Union. About 400 French troops are already in the Central African Republic, the French Defense Ministry said, where they are deployed to protect French nationals and help secure the airport in the capital, Bangui. France is a former colonial power in the Central African Republic. Former leader Gen. Francois Bozize fled the country in March of this year, after a coup led by rebel leader Michel Djotodia. A transitional government was put in place, headed by Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye, but the country continues to be wracked by unrest and new elections have yet to be held. In a piece published Monday by French newspaper Le Figaro, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the troubled Central African Republic was facing its worst crisis yet. He highlighted the threat to peace posed by growing tensions between the country's Muslims and Christians, which have already led to a number of deaths. 'Suffering beyond imagination' U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson warned Monday that the situation in the country was deteriorating rapidly and called on the international community to act swiftly to turn it around. "The population is enduring suffering beyond imagination," he told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council. "As we see far too often, women and children are bearing the brunt. Human rights violations are mounting. The use of child soldiers is rising. Sexual violence is growing. "There are widespread reports of looting, illegal checkpoints, extortion, illegal arrests and detentions, torture and summary executions." Eliasson also highlighted the worsening humanitarian situation in the country, saying that as much as a third of the population is in need of food, health care, clean water and shelter. He suggested that a U.N. peacekeeping force should eventually replace the current African-led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic, known as MISCA. That potential force could number about 6,000 troops and 1,700 police personnel, he said. In the meantime, however, he called for the international community to give its full backing to the efforts of the current mission. A new leadership team for the mission was announced Saturday, with retired Maj. Gen. Jean Marie Michel Mokoko of the Republic of Congo at its head. Humanitarian crisis Adonia Ayebare, ambassador for the African Union's permanent mission to the United Nations, warned Monday of "disastrous" humanitarian consequences, with hundreds of thousands of civilians either internally displaced or refugees in neighboring countries. He called on transitional authorities to "fully assume their responsibilities," particularly the protection of civilians and the transition to an elected government. As many as one in 10 people have been forced from their homes since March, humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders said Tuesday. Recent clashes in the town of Bouca, in the northeast part of the country, have only added to the problem, the organization said. "The fighting in Bouca is indicative of how horrific violence is engulfing the Central African Republic," said Sylvain Groulx, head of the group's mission there. "We are extremely concerned about the living conditions of the displaced, who are overcrowded in churches, mosques or schools, or living in the bush with no access to health care, food, or water, and are threatened by epidemics. Much more needs to be done, and it needs to be done now." CNN's Lilia Blaise and Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report. 0 Comments ?

Shoichet , CNN November 28, 2013 -- Updated 0616 GMT (1416 HKT) STORY HIGHLIGHTS Investigators say they've found human remains of 54 victims Many bodies show signs of being bound, gagged and tortured They have not yet been identified Drug cartels operate in the region and are battling for control Read this story in Spanish at CNNMexico.com (CNN) -- Police digging up mass graves in western Mexico have now found human remains from at least 54 victims there. The grim figure released by Mexico's Attorney General's Office Tuesday was the latest since authorities made the startling find this month of dozens of hidden graves during an investigation into the disappearance of two federal agents. So far, authorities haven't said whether the missing agents' bodies have turned up in the hidden graves found in La Barca, a town near the border of Mexico's Jalisco and Michoacan states. Prosecutors say they haven't identified the bodies they've found. Some of the victims showed signs of being bound, gagged and tortured, investigators said this week. Hidden grave may hold clues to missing Mexican youths Authorities believe municipal police officers were tied to the federal agents' disappearances, Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said. "We detained them, and from that investigation, we found a place where the federal agents might have been buried," he said. For years, authorities have described police corruption in Mexico as one of their top concerns as they combat drug cartels. Federal officials have said the lower salaries of local police officers make them more susceptible to corruption. Last month 13 police officers in the Pacific resort city of Acapulco were arrested and accused of running a kidnapping gang. The discovery of the hidden graves comes amid high tensions in the region, where cartels are battling for turf and government forces are cracking down on emerging citizen self-defense groups. Hundreds of bodies found in Bosnia mass grave CNNMexico and CNN's Elwyn Lopez and Rey Rodriguez contributed to this report. 0 Comments ?

STORY HIGHLIGHTS Boko Haram militants attacked an air base in Maiduguri early Monday The Nigerian government issued at 24 hours curfew forcing people to stay inside The region in northeastern Nigeria has been under a state of emergency since May Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Hundreds of Boko Haram militants attacked an Air Force base and a military checkpoint in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri early Monday, according to government officials. Loud explosions were heard between 3 and 4 a.m. and several ambulances were seen leaving the base. The number of casualties is unknown. The governor of Borno state has imposed a strict 24-hour curfew forcing citizens to remain indoors and all air traffic in the state has been halted. Borno is one of three embattled states in northeastern Nigeria that have been under a state of emergency since May as the region is the hotbed for Boko Haram Islamists trying to impose a strict version of Sharia, or Islamic law. Last week Human Rights Watch said Boko Haram has abducted scores of women and girls and used children as young as 13 in their campaign of violence. The report says Boko Haram has killed 3,000 people since 2009.

U.N.: 'Massive evidence' that Syrian regime linked to war crimes - CNN.com EDITION: ?INTERNATIONAL U.S. M?XICO ARABIC TV : ? CNNi CNN en Espa?ol Set edition preference Sign up Log in Home Video World U.S. Africa Asia Europe Latin America Middle East Business World Sport Entertainment Tech Travel iReport SHARE THIS Print Email More sharing Reddit StumbleUpon Delicious 'Massive evidence' links Syrian regime to war crimes, U.N. official says By CNN Staff December 2, 2013 -- Updated 2023 GMT (0423 HKT) U.N.'s human rights chief Navi Pillay says there is massive evidence for war crimes in Syria. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Report accuses "the highest levels of Syria's government" of war crimes Rebels are also implicated in the commission of war crimes, report says War crimes in Syria are "very serious crimes ... crimes against humanity" The majority of people have been killed by conventional weapons, not chemical ones (CNN) -- A United Nations fact-finding team has found "massive evidence" that the highest levels of the Syrian government are responsible for war crimes in the nation's long-running civil war, the U.N.'s human rights chief said Monday. Navi Pillay didn't name President Bashar al-Assad, but she said the evidence collected by the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria implicates the regime's top man. The panel's members have "outlined their view that the facts point to the commission of very serious crimes, war crimes, crimes against humanity," Pillay, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland. "They point to the fact that the evidence indicates responsibility at the highest level of government, including the head of state." Still, Pillay declined to say whether al-Assad was named in a list of suspects that the panel produced. The list is confidential -- not to be released until the matter goes from the fact-finding stage to a formal international investigation -- and even she has not read it, she said. Inside the battle for Damascus Bulgaria: Coping with Syrian refugees Pillay said the evidence also shows that rebels have committed war crimes and pointed to the fact that the majority of deaths -- more than 100,000 since the civil war began in 2011 -- are from unlawful attacks with conventional weapons, not from chemical weapons, which have gotten much of the attention in recent months. A joint Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations team charged with overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons began inspecting sites in October. The U.N. Security Council resolution that authorized the mission set a deadline of mid-2014 for Syria to destroy its chemical weapons or face consequences. The goal is to move the most dangerous chemicals out of the country as quickly as possible, said Sigrid Kaag, head of the joint team. But the presence of chemical weapons inspectors has not stopped the influx of conventional weapons into Syria's civil war. As recently as September, U.S. officials confirmed that they sent artillery described as light weapons, some anti-tank weapons and ammunition to Syrian rebels, and Russia has long supplied arms to the Syria's government. Pillay called on U.N. member states to refer the report to the International Criminal Court, a move that might be blocked by the U.N Security council, where Russia and China have so far blocked efforts that could punish the Assad regime. 0 Comments ?

Investigators found the bodies in a grave close to a military camp in the village of Diago, just north of Bamako, spokeswoman Alasane Diarra said. Last week, Gen. Amadou Sanogo, who led the March 2012 coup, was arrested, charged with complicity in kidnapping. A failed counter-coup shortly after he seized power pitted two army factions against each other: the green berets loyal to Sanogo and the red berets loyal to ousted President Amadou Toumani Toure. "At the military camp in Diago, there were both green berets and red berets soldiers. We do not know which group the soldiers in the grave belonged to," Diarra said. Investigations into alleged kidnapping and killings after the military takeover that plunged the West African country into chaos have been ongoing since April 30, 2012. "The investigators have been working on the case since April, so just after the coup. They have known about the grave for a while, but when they finally went there and opened the grave, there were more bodies than they previously thought," Diarra said. The bodies are all male and from different ethnic groups, she said. As the bodies are removed from the grave, forensic investigators will start the process of identifying the men. "Families of soldiers who disappeared during the coup will be asked to come and identify their family members," Diarra said. 0 Comments ?

A couple, each armed with a handgun, entered the store and managed to escape with several luxury watches, police said. $1.3 million reward for Cannes jewelry Police declined to give an estimate for the value of the stolen goods, but CNN affiliate BFMTV reported that they were worth 800,000 euros (about U.S. $1.1 million). No one was hurt during the robbery, police said. It is not the first large heist in the high-end neighborhood this year.

But Nagaoka is not your average ambitious sportswoman. She is 99 years old and only took up swimming when she was in her early 80s. "I don't care about my age," says Nagaoka. "I can't believe I'm 99. I still feel I like challenging everything." Her coach is also full of praise for Nagaoka, saying she is "the type who just doesn't want to be defeated and is strongly determined to win more gold medals, world records." See also: The ancient forests of Yakushima, Japan's eco-paradise I can't believe I'm 99. I still feel I like challenging everything Mieko Nagaoka Nagaoka is among a growing number of elderly Japanese who not only challenge but also shatter stereotypes of what aging means in the country. Japan's demographic crisis is well-known: around one quarter of the Japanese population -- 31.86 million -- are 65 or older, according to government figures published in September, a record high. It is estimated there are over 54,000 centenarians, a 6% increase from 2012. With the world's longest life expectancy (84 years), and one of the lowest birthrates, Japan is expected to see sales of adult diapers overtake those of baby diapers by 2020. However not all senior citizens are enjoying retirement. With 1 in 5 senior citizens employed, according to the Statistics Bureau of Japan, the country has the highest proportion of working seniors in the developed world. Financial necessities and boredom are among the most commonly cited reasons. But even if they don't have to work for a living, many elderly Japanese don't want to live in isolation. Though not all can replicate the active achievements of Mieko Nagaoka, many senior citizens still have enough energy to spare or keep an active social life. Take for example, the Pom Pom Grannies, a cheerleading squad with an average age of 67. The routines are not just a physical exercise, according to the 81-year-old founder Fumie Takino, but help keep one's mind sharp as well. In an attempt to deal with swelling pension costs, Japan is gradually raising the retirement age to 65, from 60 last year. See also: Mapping Mount Fuji with Google Street View But, active seniors say the public is so used with the stereotype image of the elderly who are frail or walking with a cane that many Japanese have difficulties with the idea of seeing the elderly stay active, let alone shouting and prancing with a pom-pom. "Some people deny, cannot accept us. Why?" says Takino. "Japanese senior ladies are supposed to be decent and, you know... not this." Many of the women shared their bewilderment at the younger generation. "They just play on this, er, what do you call it? Facebook? They don't talk much. They just exchange on this Facebook. That's not good thing," says Takino. That is surely one lesson these active seniors can teach the younger generation. Yenni Kwok contributed to this report .

Uruguay to legalize marijuana, Senate says - CNN.com EDITION: ?INTERNATIONAL U.S. M?XICO ARABIC TV : ? CNNi CNN en Espa?ol Set edition preference Sign up Log in Home Video World U.S. Africa Asia Europe Latin America Middle East Business World Sport Entertainment Tech Travel iReport SHARE THIS Print Email More sharing Reddit StumbleUpon Delicious Uruguay to legalize marijuana, Senate says By Dario Klein , Catherine E. Shoichet and Rafael Romo , CNN December 11, 2013 -- Updated 0242 GMT (1042 HKT) Supporters of legalizing marijuana demonstrate outside Uruguay's Senate. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Uruguayan lawmakers vote to legalize marijuana Supporters say it will help fight organized crime Critics say it could have dangerous health consequences Montevideo, Uruguay (CNN) -- The passage of a landmark marijuana legalization measure Tuesday means Uruguay is set to become the first country in the world to have a system regulating legal production, sale and consumption of the drug. It's practically a done deal. President Jose Mujica has to sign the bill before it becomes a law. But he's long backed the measure, and there's little doubt that he remains behind it. Applause and cheers rang out in Uruguay's Senate on Tuesday after the high-profile vote at the end of a lengthy debate on the bill. The measure passed Uruguay's lower house in July . Supporters of the proposal have said it marks a turning point and could inspire other Latin American nations to take a similar approach. It places the South American country at the vanguard of liberal drug policies, surpassing even the Netherlands, where recreational drugs are illegal but a policy of tolerance is in place. "It is understood that a regulation-based policy has positive consequences for health and public security, given that, on the one hand, it can produce better results when it comes to education, prevention, information, treatment and rehabilitation in relation to the problematic uses of drugs," said Sen. Roberto Conde of Uruguay's Broad Front coalition, which supported the measure. "On the other hand, it helps fight drug trafficking, which fuels organized crime and criminal activities that affect the security of the population." Critics said legalizing marijuana could have dangerous consequences. "This bill, which proposes an experiment in social engineering, as it was described in the public health commission, does not comply with any of the ethical safeguards of experimentation with human beings," said Sen. Alfredo Solari of the Colorado Party. "Those safeguards are extremely important ... given that we're talking about marijuana, a substance that harms human beings." A letter sent by Mujica's government to lawmakers last year presented the bill. He told CNN en Espa?ol last year that he supported legalizing marijuana. "If we legalize it, we think that we will spoil the market (for drug traffickers) because we are going to sell it for cheaper than it is sold on the black market," he said. "And we are going to have people identified." Conservative critics of the measure have said it promotes drug addiction and have suggested that Mujica's comments were uninformed. Details still in the works The proposed law would allow individuals to grow up to six plants of marijuana and possess as many as 480 grams for personal use. Marijuana clubs of anywhere from 15 to 45 members would also be allowed and granted permission to grow up to 99 plants at a time. Users would have to register, and those claiming to use cannabis for medical reasons would have to show a doctor's prescription. Marijuana would also be sold at licensed pharmacies. Once the bill becomes law, there will be a 120-day period to give the government time to adopt regulations and implement it. Consumption of marijuana has been legal Uruguay, but its production and sale are not. "We seek to eliminate that incongruence," the country's top drug official, Julio Calzada, told CNN earlier this year . The same debates about marijuana that exist in the United States -- about medicinal properties, recreational use, the impact on the justice system -- have been happening in Uruguay for a long time, Calzada said. The decision to push legislation to overhaul its drug policies did not come overnight. "We have reflected on our problems," Calzada said, and the government felt that Uruguay's tradition of tolerance and equality merited action on the marijuana issue. Widespread debate But many in the traditionally Catholic country of 3.3 million people feel supporters are espousing the wrong policy for the wrong reasons. In a July poll from CIFRA/Gonzalez, Raga and Associates, 63% of Uruguayan respondents said they disagreed with the bill. Only 26% said they approved of the measure in the poll, which surveyed more than 1,000 Uruguayans and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Opponent Solari says making marijuana widely available has the potential to create even higher levels of addiction. "It's a very bad piece of legislation, mainly because it increases the availability of marijuana in the market," he said. Backers of the bill say the legislation addresses some of the concerns expressed by the opposition. For one, violators of the law would face sentences of 20 months to 10 years in prison. Those younger than 18 would not be allowed to use marijuana under any circumstances. The legislation also calls for mandatory classes in public schools aimed at drug prevention and bans the advertising of cannabis in any form.

STORY HIGHLIGHTS Island on the eastern edges of the Mediterranean Sea has had a long history of conquest It has been conquered by Arab armies, the Venetians and the Ottomans and was a British colony In 1974, Turkish forces invaded Cyprus partitioning the north into a zone for Turkish Cypriots Until recent the recent banking crisis the Republic of Cyprus has grown to have one of the most successful economies in the region Editor's note: CNN's On the Road series brings you a greater insight into the customs and culture of Cyprus . CNN.com explores the places, the people and the passions unique to this eastern Mediterranean island. (CNN) -- Strategically located in the eastern Mediterranean, Cyprus has stood at one of the geographical, cultural and economic fault-lines between East and West since ancient times. In mythology, it was the birthplace of the Ancient Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite, however the island has seen plenty of conflict throughout its history. When the Roman Empire divided in the 4th century, Cyprus came under the rule of the Byzantine Empire, developing the Hellenistic-Christian culture that remains the hallmark of Greek Cypriots today. But for the next 1,500 years, Cyprus remained at the mercy of successive waves of foreign invaders. Cypriot legend claims the Greek goddess of love, rose out of the foam near a rock off Aphrodite's Beach. Many claim the waves breaking over the rock create pillars of foam that looks just like her. During the Arab-Byzantine wars between the 7th and 11th century, Cyprus was subject to everything from small piratical raids to full-scale assaults in which thousands were slaughtered. The cycle of invasion and foreign rule continued to the mid-20th century as Cyprus fell variously to Richard I of England during the Third Crusade, the French under the Lusignans and the Venetians in the 15th century. Read more: What's Cyprus' connection to wine and the crusades? When the Ottoman Empire launched a successful full-scale attack in 1570, the scene was set for the divisions between Turkish and Greek Cypriots that exist on the Mediterranean island until today. Cyprus in the 20th century By the time Cyprus came under British administration in 1878, Greek Cypriots were already agitating for union with Greece. A referendum in 1950 that was boycotted by Turkish Cypriots came out heavily in favor of union with Greece. Inter-communal violence fractured the Turkish and Greek Cypriot communities after the country gained independence in 1960 and Turkey threatened to invade in a series of events that became a Cold War flashpoint in 1963 and 1964. Only the involvement of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson halted a Turkish invasion when he stated that the U.S. would not stand beside the NATO member in the event of a Soviet invasion of Turkish territory. In July 1974, the Greek military junta backed a coup d'etat in Cyprus. In response Turkey launched military intervention and by August it had landed thousands of troops and successfully partitioned the island along what is known as the "Green Line." Around 180,000 Greek Cypriots were forced south and some 50,000 Turkish Cypriots moved into vacant properties in the northern Turkish occupied zone. Locals playing backgammon outside a cafe in Nicosia. Cyprus has existed as a de-facto divided country ever since and the events of the bloody summer of 1974 still dominate, not just the politics of the island, but Greco-Turkish relations in general. In 1983, the administration in northern Cyprus declared the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)"; an entity that is not recognized internationally by any country other than Turkey. Efforts to resolve the conflict have ended in failure. Attempts at reconciliation In 2004, the Annan Plan, named after then U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, led to a referendum on reunification which was supported by Turkish Cypriots but rejected by the Greek side as being too heavily weighted in favor of the Turkish side. Despite this setback, Cypriots have been chipping away at partition. In 2008, Greek Cypriots demolished a key section of the barrier dividing the island's capital city Nicosia. Ledra Street -- a pedestrianized shopping area -- became the sixth crossing point on the divided island. At the time, the move was welcomed by then leader of the Turkish north Ferdi Sabit Soyer who was reported as calling it "a positive development." In 2004, Cyprus gained accession to the European Union which recognized its entry as a whole but suspended its legislation in the Turkish north, saying that "these areas are outside of the customs and fiscal territory of the EU. But the EU notes that this does not affect the personal rights of Turkish Cypriots as EU citizens." Economic ups and downs Erratic growth in the 1990s -- largely due to fluctuations in tourist arrivals that reflected the island's political instability -- gave way to stronger growth. The Republic of Cyprus was first listed as an advanced economy by the International Monetary Fund in 2001. According to the IMF, Cypriots are among the most prosperous people in in the Mediterranean region with GDP per capita surpassing $26,000 in 2012. Economists say the turnaround was made all the more spectacular when partition is taken into account. After 1974, Cypriots in the south lost 65% of their hotel and tourist accommodation, 46% of its industrial sector and 56% of its mining and quarrying production. Read more on Cyprus: Betting on an off-shore gas bonanza The Republic of Cyprus experienced rapid economic growth as it rebuilt its tourism industry after losing much of its infrastructure in the north after the invasion of 1974. In the north, however, the economy struggles. Demonstrators against the EU bailout pamphlet during a student parade in March in Nicosia, According to the CIA World Factbook, its GDP remains one quarter the size of the south and, with Turkey its primary public and private investor, its per capita GDP is around half that of the south. Meanwhile, Cyprus has successfully parlayed its role as a hub between East and West, rising as a significant business center in the region and becoming a haven for the assets of many wealthy Russians In 2012, however, the growth story faltered and Russian bank accounts along with those of Cypriots and EU citizens with unsecured funds were badly hit. In a major economic crisis, Cypriot banks exposed to local property companies, the Greek Debt Crisis and hammered by a junk rating downgrade by international ratings agencies, Cypriot banks teetered on the verge of collapse. Only a ?10 billion ($13.7 billion) EU bailout package, which included those losses for depositors, averted a financial disaster that threatened to drag the Mediterranean financial sector down with it. Ironically for partitioned Cyprus, the solution from the Eurogroup was to split the country's second largest bank - the Cyprus Popular Bank - into two banks; one "bad" which would be wound down over time and one "good" that would be absorbed by the Bank of Cyprus.

Northern Ireland leaders condemn Belfast bomb blast - CNN.com EDITION: ?INTERNATIONAL U.S. M?XICO ARABIC TV : ? CNNi CNN en Espa?ol Set edition preference Sign up Log in Home Video World U.S. Africa Asia Europe Latin America Middle East Business World Sport Entertainment Tech Travel iReport SHARE THIS Print Email More sharing Reddit StumbleUpon Delicious Northern Ireland leaders condemn Belfast bomb blast By Peter Taggart and Laura Smith-Spark , CNN December 14, 2013 -- Updated 1320 GMT (2120 HKT) STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: First Minister Peter Robinson condemns Belfast bomb blast as "despicable" A warning was telephoned to a newspaper but the wrong location was given, police said Police say the small bomb, left in central Belfast, could have killed or injured passersby Sinn Fein lawmaker condemns "reckless" act by people whose "only allegiance is to violence" Belfast (CNN) -- Northern Ireland's leaders condemned Saturday the detonation of a small bomb in central Belfast that police said could have killed or injured people. The device, left in a holdall bag, exploded at about 7 p.m. local time Friday in Belfast's busy Cathedral Quarter, near St. Anne's Cathedral, police said. No one was hurt. First Minister Peter Robinson described the attack as "despicable," while Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said it showed a "complete disregard for life." IRA dissidents are widely suspected of being behind the attack. A warning was telephoned through to a Belfast newspaper, but the wrong location was given for the device, police said. It was left on a sidewalk by a busy restaurant and the explosion occurred as police were still clearing buildings in the area, which included a hotel, a bar and an arts center. Chief Superintendent Alan McCrum said anyone nearby when the device went off could have been killed or maimed. "This was an attack on the people of Belfast going about their normal lives on a busy night for socializing in the city," he said. "Those who carried out this attack have nothing to offer except disruption and destruction." McCrum appealed for the public to be vigilant in the run-up to Christmas against the threat of further attacks. More than 1,000 people were affected by the bomb threat and subsequent evacuation efforts, police said. Police are also investigating reports of fire damage to an office of the Alliance Party. The party last year backed a controversial decision by the Belfast city council to stop flying the Union flag every day, angering loyalists. 'Mindless minority' In their statement condemning Friday's explosion, Robinson and McGuinness urged anyone with information to contact the police. "Once again we are witnessing the work of a mindless minority who are intent on taking the heart out of the city and wreaking havoc on the lives and businesses of the people of Belfast and Northern Ireland," said Robinson. "Their cause will not be progressed in any way by acts such as this." Northern Ireland's Justice Minister David Ford also condemned those behind the explosion. "Yet again we see a reckless attempt to kill and injure innocent people in Belfast," he said. "The people carrying out these attacks have set out no reason and explained no cause for their acts of senseless violence. Their only aim seems to be to injure and disrupt." Gerry Kelly, a Sinn Fein member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, also condemned what he called an "indiscriminate" attack on the people of Belfast. "Those that voice support for these groups, (whose) only allegiance is to violence, need to come forward and explain to the people what they aim to achieve by this reckless action," he said. "They are visionless and opponents of change who will not stop the people of Belfast and beyond from moving forward to a more equal and peaceful society." Belfast is home to the elected Northern Ireland Assembly, which was established by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. The agreement largely ended three decades of violence between mainly Protestant loyalists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and largely Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to be reunited with the rest of Ireland -- though distrust between the sides remains. Journalist Peter Taggart reported from Belfast and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. 0 Comments ?

In her victory speech, Bachelet promised to improve education and work for equality. She thanked her supporters. "Thanks to the millions of people who, today, have demonstrated with their vote that they believe in me -- just like I believe in you," she said. Bachelet was the first female president of Chile and left office with high approval ratings. In 2010, she was tapped to head U.N. Women, a United Nations agency created to promote gender equality around the world. Chilean voters first cast ballots last month, but no candidate secured enough votes then to declare victory. The South American country's constitution requires a presidential candidate to garner more than 50% of votes to win. Presidents are prohibited from seeking immediate re-election.

The human rights group says that while labor camps are being shut, research suggested that authorities are expanding the use of "black jails," enforced drug rehabilitation clinics and "brainwashing centers" to take their place. "There is a very real risk that the Chinese authorities will abolish one system of arbitrary detention only to expand the use of other types," the report said. A spokesman from China's Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the Amnesty report. Secret letter found inside Halloween toy Corinna-Barbara Francis, Amnesty International's China researcher, said the abolishment may only be a "cosmetic change just to avert the public outcry over the abusive re-education through labor system." China said on November 15 that it would close its labor camps after earlier putting the policy under review, with the move hailed as the biggest change to China's criminal justice system in decades. Detention without trial The system was set up in 1950s and allows police to detain petty offenders -- such as thieves, prostitutes and drug addicts -- for up to four years without a trial. READ: China to abolish labor camps, report says According to China's Ministry of Justice , the country had 351 labor camps at the end of 2012, with more than 50,000 inmates. Other estimates have put the number of detainees much higher. The "re-education process" has also been used to punish those detained for their political, religious or personal beliefs -- such as members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement or petitioners with complaints against local officials, Amnesty said. Torture is said to be rife at the camps. Detainees have told Amnesty International they were beaten, sometimes with electric batons, denied food, subjected to simulated drowning, injected with unknown drugs and subjected to the "rack" torture." Brainwashing centers The report said interviews with petitioners and Falun Gong practitioners revealed abuses were continuing despite the closure of the camps. READ: Chinese labor camp inmate's Halloween cry for help Some labor camps were being re-labeled as drug rehabilitation centers and released detainees were being sent to black jails -- unofficial detention centers set up in places like hotels or abandoned buildings -- or "brainwashing centers," another form of arbitrary detention. Falun Gong practitioner Zhang Zhi told Amnesty International she was released from a labor camp in Harbin in June 2013 but on her release staff from a brainwashing center were waiting for her at the gate. Her family were able to intervene and prevented her from being taken away. She has since gone into hiding. "The Chinese authorities must immediately end all forms of arbitrary detention and ensure that laws protecting detainees are brought into line with international human rights standards," Francis said. "This needs to be a fundamental change in the policies that are at the root of the repression and which strip detainees of their most basic rights."

The allegation first surfaced in August, roughly 16 years after the woman who would now be a royal grandmother died in a Paris car crash. Officers were tasked with looking into whether there was any truth to it. "Every reasonable line of enquiry was objectively pursued in order to fully evaluate any potential evidence," police said in a statement released overnight Monday. "The final conclusion is that whilst there is a possibility the alleged comments in relation to the SAS's involvement in the deaths may have been made, there is no credible evidence to support a theory that such claims had any basis in fact." Cops: No evidence of Princess Diana plot Kate vs. Diana Princess Diana's dresses for sale SAS is short for Britain's elite Special Air Service. Wildly popular in life and death, Diana died on August 31, 1997, after the car she was riding in slammed into a pillar in a Paris overpass. Her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul, also died. Investigators concluded that Paul was drunk and speeding when the accident occurred, and despite at least three inquiries -- including a lengthy London police inquiry that poured cold water on all forms of conspiracy theories in Diana's death -- whispers of collusion and cover-up have persisted. Rare photo of teenage Diana sold The latest claim, published by Press Association, the Sunday People newspaper and other British media outlets, alleged that members of Britain's elite SAS commando unit were involved in assassinating Diana. The claim appears to have been sent first to military authorities and then to London police by the parents-in-law of a British special forces sniper after his marriage had fallen apart, according to an article on the website of the Sunday People newspaper. It did not offer a source for its reporting, but the paper indicated that the parents were questioning the integrity of the soldier, who had testified in another soldier's court-martial. Sunday People said it had seen a seven-page handwritten letter by the in-laws alleging that the soldier, whom the newspaper did not name, had boasted to his wife that the commando unit was behind the deaths. Neither the Sunday People piece nor an earlier version carried by Press Association offered details of the claimed involvement by soldiers in the deaths. The princess left behind her two children, Prince William, whose wife recently gave birth to Diana's first grandchild, and Prince Harry. Some 2.5 billion people around the world watched Diana's funeral.

More than 40 were killed in Baghdad Monday, many of whom were on their way to the Shiite holy city of Karbala. Another 17 pilgrims in Mosul were also killed by militants. In Baghdad, at least 27 people were killed and more than 50 wounded when two car bombs exploded in quick succession near a procession of pilgrims making their way by foot to Karbala for the annual commemoration of the seventh century death of their Imam Hussein, a memorial called the Arbaeen.

"Russia has stabbed us in the back, and each day that Mr. Snowden is allowed to roam free is another twist of the knife," he said. Snowden's father, Lon Snowden, who has adamantly supported his son, talks to reporters in Washington on Tuesday, July 30. He has urged his son to remain in Russia "until we have assurances that he would receive a fair trial." Demonstrators in Berlin hold a protest march on Saturday, July 27, in support of Snowden and WikiLeaks document provider Bradley Manning. Both men have been portrayed as traitors and whistle-blowers. Manning was acquitted on July 30 on the most serious charge of aiding the enemy, but he was convicted on several other counts and likely faces a lengthy term in a military prison.

The letter was posted on the website pastebin and on the Facebook page of David Michael Miranda, partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald, according to a tweet from Greenwald. In the letter, Snowden says he has told Brazilian lawmakers that he is willing to help investigate "suspected crimes against Brazilian citizens." "I have expressed my willingness to assist wherever appropriate and lawful, but unfortunately the United States government has worked very hard to limit my ability to do so -- going so far as to force down the Presidential Plane of Evo Morales to prevent me from traveling to Latin America! "Until a country grants permanent political asylum, the U.S. government will continue to interfere with my ability to speak." Brazil has been in an uproar over reports of U.S. spying. In September, Brazilian lawmakers said they planned to send a commission to Russia to speak with Snowden, who had allegedly leaked information about U.S. spying against the country's president. Foreign Minister Luiz Alberto Figueiredo called the situation "an inadmissible and unacceptable violation of Brazilian sovereignty." Last month, Brazil acknowledged its own past snooping . The newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo revealed that Brazil spied on foreign diplomats inside Brazil in 2003 and 2004. Its targets included officials from Russia, Iran and the United States. "I see the situations as completely different," Brazilian Justice Minister Jose Eduardo Cardozo told the paper. Judge: NSA domestic phone data-mining unconstitutional In his letter, Snowden, a former NSA contractor, writes, "Today, if you carry a cell phone in Sao Paolo, the NSA can and does keep track of your location: they do this 5 billion times a day to people around the world. When someone in Florianopolis visits a website, the NSA keeps a record of when it happened and what you did there. If a mother in Porto Alegre calls her son to wish him luck on his university exam, NSA can keep that call log for five years or more. They even keep track of who is having an affair or looking at pornography, in case they need to damage their target's reputation. "American Senators tell us that Brazil should not worry, because this is not 'surveillance,' it's 'data collection.' They say it is done to keep you safe. They're wrong. There is a huge difference between legal programs, legitimate spying, legitimate law enforcement -- where individuals are targeted based on a reasonable, individualized suspicion -- and these programs of dragnet mass surveillance that put entire populations under an all-seeing eye and save copies forever. These programs were never about terrorism: they're about economic spying, social control, and diplomatic manipulation. They're about power."

STORY HIGHLIGHTS The crash is the deadliest single incident for U.S. troops in Afghanistan since 2012 The helicopter's engine appears to have failed, a U.S. official says There was no enemy activity near the helicopter when it went down, NATO says (CNN) -- Six U.S. troops were killed Tuesday in a helicopter crash in southern Afghanistan after what appears to be an engine failure, a U.S. defense official said. There was one survivor in the crash. The crash is the deadliest single incident for U.S. troops in Afghanistan since an August 2012 helicopter wreck killed seven U.S. service members and four Afghans. There was no enemy activity in the area at the time of Tuesday's crash, according to NATO, and the U.S. defense official said early reports indicate the helicopter's engine failed. The troops were members of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. Their names have not been released. It is ISAF policy to allow national authorities to identify casualties. Interactive: Coalition troops killed in Afghanistan, Iraq Tuesday's crash brings to 129 the number of U.S. troops who died in 2013 while supporting Operation Enduring Freedom. The vast majority of those service members were lost in Afghanistan. The year is on pace to be the least deadly for U.S. troops in the central Asian nation since 2007. At least 300 American service members died each year while supporting the Afghanistan war from 2009 to 2012. More than 2,150 U.S. troops have died in Afghanistan, or because of injuries suffered there, since the U.S.-led invasion of the country in 2001. The year's deadliest incident for ISAF troops in Afghanistan happened in June, when a suicide bomber detonated a truck bomb outside a military base in Helmand province, killing seven Georgian troops.

CNNi CNN en Espa?ol Set edition preference Sign up Log in Home Video World U.S. Africa Asia Europe Latin America Middle East Business World Sport Entertainment Tech Travel iReport Part of complete coverage on On China SHARE THIS Print Email More sharing Reddit StumbleUpon Delicious Mind the gap: China's great education divide By Kristie Lu Stout, CNN December 17, 2013 -- Updated 0630 GMT (1430 HKT) STORY HIGHLIGHTS 15 year olds in Shanghai rank number one in the world in reading, math and science But critics argue exam results are not representative of the city's total student population Debate about the quality of education available in China's poorer, rural interior China released a 10-year national education reform plan in 2010 to tackle the problem Editor's note: This month's episode of On China with Kristie Lu Stout tackles education and airs for the first time on Wednesday, December 18 at 6.30pm Hong Kong/Beijing time. For all viewing times please click here. Shanghai (CNN) -- So, they apparently did it again. For the second time in a decade, 15-year-olds in Shanghai have scored at the top of the PISA global education assessment , ranking number one in the world in reading, math and science. The Chinese city has a top performing system thanks in part to the strong drive and self-belief of its students, says OECD special advisor on education policy -- and PISA survey head -- Andreas Schleicher. "In Shanghai, you have nine out of ten students telling you, 'It depends on me. If I invest the effort, my teachers are going to help me to be successful,'" Schleicher tells me during a taping of CNN's "On China" on location in the city. The Shanghai exam results have come under fire for shutting out the city's migrant children and not being representative of the city's total student population -- something the OECD refutes . Can China replicate Shanghai's triumph? Chinese students look elsewhere to live But one thing is for certain. The results are not representative of a nation. China as a whole does not take the PISA exam. Data on a number of Chinese cities and provinces is not yet published by PISA. China as a whole is expected to be included in the 2015 assessment. Data from the Rural Education Action Program (REAP) at Stanford University in the United States provides a stark picture of how Shanghai's education success is not repeated in China's less wealthy, rural interior. While 84% of high school grads in Shanghai go to college, less than 5% of China's rural poor make it to university . High school attendance is just 40% in poor, rural areas of China. And as they struggle with poverty and debate the opportunity cost of simply going to class, a significant number of rural students start dropping out in middle school. Why are students dropping out? Across the world's second biggest economy, the education system is vastly unequal. But incredibly, Schleicher tells me a child from a poor background in China has a better chance to be well educated than poor, rural students in other countries. It is a huge misconception that local communities aren't invested in the education of their children and grandchildren. Andrea Pasinetti, Teach for China "The learning environment you would encounter there, the quality is a lot higher than what you'd encounter in a similar context almost anywhere else in the world," he says. READ: What Asian schools can teach the world Seated across from Schleicher during the "On China" panel discussion in Shanghai is Andrea Pasinetti, the founder of Teach for China -- a non-profit that brings graduates from China and the U.S. to teach at some of China's most under-resourced schools. Pasinetti reveals a particularly bullish view on rural education in China: "A lot of these (rural) schools tend to be boarding schools. So the school provides not only a context for classroom instruction, it also provides a context for personal growth and exploration." Pasinetti's views are distinctly out of sync with that of educator Jiang Xueqin, currently the Deputy Principal of Tsinghua University High School. "Kids in the rural regions are at a huge disadvantage. Teachers and school are under-resourced," he says. "The other issue is that in the rural regions, there's a lot of movement so parents move to the cities leaving their kids behind in the schools. So there isn't that parental support and guidance that kids need to thrive. "Rural schools are under a lot of cultural stigma. No one in China believes they will succeed." Though Jiang's assessment is in line with what has generally been reported about China's rural education challenges, Pasinetti calls it an "irresponsible perception." "It is a huge misconception that local communities aren't invested in the education of their children and grandchildren," says the Teach for China founder. READ: Price of Shanghai's school success Over the years it will become worse and worse. The rich and powerful are choosing to detach themselves from the traditional school system. Jiang Xueqin, Tsinghua University High School "I speak to grandmothers who are illiterate, who live often on two or three dollars a day... who would do anything and stop at nothing to make sure that the child they have in their home is able to achieve a great education. "The big difficulty is that oftentimes, they don't know where to start." The Chinese government is attempting to tackle the challenge. In 2010, China released a 10-year national education reform plan. Among other objectives, it plans to focus less on tests and get the best teachers into the rural communities that desperately need them. READ: Remote classroom illustrates China's education challenges "Every discussion you have with Chinese officials about education reform revolves around the question of equity," says Pasinetti. But Jiang is not optimistic about the prospects for education equity in China. "Over the years it will become worse and worse," he says. "The rich and powerful are choosing to detach themselves from the traditional school system." Jiang sees a China where the wealthy will move education resources to a system of new private schools that cater only to them. And that is the dark future China must avoid. "If you don't change the school system now, you'll get people buying themselves out of it," says Schleicher. "That's basically the challenge that China has." 0 Comments ?

North Korea's top brass marks Kim Jong Il's death - CNN.com EDITION: ?INTERNATIONAL U.S. M?XICO ARABIC TV : ? CNNi CNN en Espa?ol Set edition preference Sign up Log in Home Video World U.S. Africa Asia Europe Latin America Middle East Business World Sport Entertainment Tech Travel iReport SHARE THIS Print Email More sharing Reddit StumbleUpon Delicious North Korea's top brass commemorates Kim Jong Il's death By Madison Park , CNN December 17, 2013 -- Updated 0805 GMT (1605 HKT) North Korean soldiers pay their respects at the base of statues of the late leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Two-year anniversary marked for death of Kim Jong Il North Korea's top brass attended ceremony Attention to North Korea after execution of Kim Jong Un's uncle New: More restrictions in North Korea (CNN) -- On the second anniversary of the death of former North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, the nation held a memorial in his honor, lauding his life and achievements. During the ceremony, his son, Kim Jong Un sat front and center below the image of his father, which was festooned in gold-colored flowers. He assumed power after his father's death in 2011. The memorial marking the death of the elder Kim brought out what looked like thousands of party members and military personnel, who dressed in black or in green uniforms, into Pyongyang Gymnasium. They clapped in in synchrony, raising their hands above their shoulders. The anniversary came a week after an uncharacteristically public announcement of the execution of Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek that raised speculation about turmoil within the North Korean leadership. Showing allegiance During Tuesday's ceremony, the remaining top brass, appearing solemn, flanked Kim. All the levels of power and control of North Korea appeared to be there, to show allegiance to Kim and the state, said Daniel Pinkston, senior analyst of the North East Asia region for the International Crisis Group. Actions of NK leader "very dangerous" On GPS, an execution in North Korea The state of North Korea Reports: Kim Jong-Un's Uncle executed Anniversary ceremonies pertaining to the North Korea's founder, Kim Il Sung and his son, Kim Jong Il are common. "Kim Jong Un is using those dates for ceremonies as opportunities to have people in the leadership extend pledges of allegiance and loyalty to the regime, to the party and Kim Jong Un as a leader," said Pinkston. "There was a lot more eyes on it because of the recent purging and execution of Jang Song Thaek." 'Human bullets and bombs' In a separate event on Monday, members of the North Korean military -- the Korean People's Army -- swore to uphold Kim as leader and to defend him unto death at a meeting at Kumsusan Palace, reported the North Korean state news agency, KCNA. The participants "solemnly pledged to become human bullets and bombs" and to know only Kim, according to KCNA. The execution of Jang last week came as a shock. Jang, who was Kim's uncle by marriage, had been regarded as the second-most powerful figure in the secretive nation. Denounced as a "traitor for all ages" and "worse than a dog," he was executed for trying to overthrow the state "by all sorts of intrigues and despicable methods." His crimes on KCNA included: Behaving arrogantly, unwilling to stand up from his seat and "half-heartedly clapping." His widow and the current North Korean leader's aunt, Kim Kyong-hui did not appear to attend the Tuesday anniversary commemorating the death of her brother. However, she was mentioned in a KCNA report this weekend, suggesting she had survived her husband's purge. For the rest of the North Korean population, the situation may be tense. Sokeel Park, director of Research and Strategy at Liberty in North Korea, an NGO, said he had heard from defectors secretly communicating with family members inside North Korea that there have been greater restrictions. This is common during anniversaries marking the Kims. North Korean leader's uncle put to death Korean media: Kim's uncle 'worse than a dog' "I've heard of increased restrictions on movement, and increased restriction on the market," Park said. "The general atmosphere is one of lockdown. Combine that with the quite shocking news to North Korea that Jang Song Thaek was looking to overthrow the leadership -- that's shocking in any society. That contributes to this tense atmosphere among North Korean people." Signs of instability ? The execution of Jang has unsettled some North Korea observers as well as its neighbors, as they look for signs of instability in the government and possibility of provocation. The South Korean defense ministry said Jang's death could be a major turning point in North Korea since the founding of its power 68 years ago and there could be a provocation early next year. But the ministry's spokesman Kim Min-seok said that there is no "imminent sign of North Korea carrying out nuclear and missile tests." Park Geun-hye, the South Korean president said on Monday before a meeting with diplomatic and security ministers, that she could not rule out "reckless provocations" from the north. U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry called Kim "reckless" and" insecure" following the execution of his uncle, stating that it makes having a nuclear weapon in the hands of somebody like him "even more unacceptable." CNN's KJ Kwon in Seoul contributed to this report. 0 Comments ?

Angela Merkel voted into 3rd term as German chancellor - CNN.com EDITION: ?INTERNATIONAL U.S. M?XICO ARABIC TV : ?

The election results showed again that she is one of the most popular politicians in Germany. Flip through these images to see her career in the making. Merkel originally trained as a physicist. This picture, taken in 1989, shows her with her now husband, Joachim Sauer, and quantum chemistry professor Malgorzata Jeziorska during a summer school in the Polish city of Bachotek. Merkel meets Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve as the leader of Germany's opposition in April 2001. November 22, 2005: Merkel is sworn in as Germany's chancellor. She became the first woman, the first East German and the youngest person to lead modern Germany. December 2005: Merkel takes part in her first big European summit. According to her biographer, she stayed at work until 3 a.m., making sure an agreement was reached. Merkel has reportedly been afraid of dogs since she was bitten by one in 1995. Russian President Vladimir Putin , apparently aware of her dislike of the animals, made headlines by bringing his pet Labrador Koni into a meeting with Merkel in 2007. The famous trouser suit: Merkel presents U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with a German newspaper's front page photo of their trouser-suited hips in 2011. Merkel shares a passion for opera with her camera-shy husband, Joachim Sauer. Here they are pictured arriving for the opening of the Bayreuth Wagner Opera Festival in July 2012. A big football fan, Merkel celebrates Germany scoring a goal against Greece during the Euro 2012 football championships quarter-final match in Gdansk .

The coalition is made up of Merkel's conservative bloc, her Christian Democratic Union party and the allied Christian Social Union, and the center-left Social Democrats. Merkel was re-elected by 462 votes in Germany's lower house, or Bundestag, with 150 votes against and nine abstentions, and was sworn in as chancellor soon afterward. Her Cabinet is also due to be sworn in Tuesday. The parliamentary vote came after members of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) overwhelmingly approved the coalition deal in a postal ballot. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso wrote to Merkel to congratulate her on her re-election, saying it "constitutes both an endorsement of your past efforts and a signal of confidence for the coming years." He added that he was looking forward to "constructive and fruitful cooperation" with the German government in the future, as the European Union continues its efforts to counter the effects of the global financial crisis. Merkel's election to another four-year term brings to an end nearly three months of uncertainty for Germany, the eurozone's economic powerhouse. Merkel emerged from September elections with the CDU's biggest vote in 20 years . But the CDU and CSU did not win an outright victory, requiring them to form a coalition government. The pro-business Free Democrats, Merkel's previous coalition partner, failed to pass the 5% threshold for getting into parliament, putting a grand coalition with the SPD, the CDU's chief election rival, in the frame. The coalition agreement, hammered out last month, includes a new nationwide minimum wage of 8.50 euros ($11.50) an hour beginning January 2015 and other measures favored by the SPD. Merkel's third term will give the country consistent leadership at a time when the future of the euro has come under question amid the economic problems of some eurozone members. While Germany has emerged from the crisis with its economy relatively intact, nations such as Greece have entered deep recessions while unemployment has soared.

But his home is as magical as anywhere he might have set food on his travels. Just outside Paris, behind the fence made of cats, Slava and his wife Elena live in the expansive Moulin Jaune (Yellow Windmill). The psychedelically decorated house is a retreat that aims to feed Polunin and his friends' creative imaginations.

Slava hosts workshops and festivals at his home, inviting creative contemporaries and young people to share in the surreal atmosphere. Those lucky enough to be invited can see: colorful murals ...

(CNN) -- It's a crisp November morning and Slava Polunin is paddling his way down an idyllic river -- in a floating bed. The 63-year-old Russian isn't escaping some sort of natural disaster. Instead, the white-haired man with bulging red nose and yellow raincoat is doing what clowns do best -- making us laugh. "The art of clowning is filled with fantasy and absurdity -- a collision of the incompatible," he says, speaking from his surreal fairytale home outside of Paris. "It's a way to create a new world, rather than repeat the existing one. For example, rather than making your way out through the door, you would make your way out through the window, as it's closer to the tram stop." Polunin is one of the most famous clowns working in the world today, winning an Olivier Award for his ethereal Snow Show , and performing in 50 countries across the globe in a remarkable career that began in Soviet Russia four decades ago. Fantasy land Stepping inside Polunin's rambling home is like walking into a dream -- staircases melt into the walls, a psychedelic caravan parked out front beckons the visitor inside, and childlike murals swirl on every surface. Indeed, there's barely a right angle in sight in the dizzying house of rainbow, folk-inspired knick-knacks. Windows of every shape and size give a glimpse to the lush gardens outside -- not to mention the emerald river with an iron bed boat moored to its banks. It's a place to feed Polunin's imagination, which in recent years has helped revolutionize the world of clowning -- transporting it from the big top to the theater stage. Read: The street kid who grew into a 'Snake Man' Rather than the buffoonery of the circus, Polunin's clown is a more thoughtful, poetic character, with a minimalist style. A pantomime dame with a twist Creating magic with physical theater "At the beginning of my career, my clowning was filled with movement, like a child, when you are filled with so much energy that you think you could jump to the sky," he said. "Today my perception of clowning is that you should be able to move just one centimeter and get a reaction from the audience as if you moved an entire mountain." Childlike Chaplin It was watching Charlie Chaplin film "The Kid" on TV as a seven-year-old growing up in Soviet Russia, that Polunin first decided to make a career out of clowning. "My mom turned the TV off because it was time for me to go to bed, and I cried all night as I wanted to know what would happen next in the movie," he said. "The next day, when I was about to leave for school, I thought: 'I have to wear something similar to Charlie Chaplin.' So I took my father's boots, hat and a cane and went to school. I made my friends laugh for the entire evening." Read this: 'Perfectionist' Chaplin demanded 342 takes for one movie scene Polunin was fascinated by the way movement could convey emotion, and studied dances from across the world -- everything from Japan's surreal Butoh performances, to rock 'n roll, and tango. He even analyzed the way Disney cartoon characters held certain poses. "In order to learn how to move as a clown, I imitate the way kids, insane people, drunkards and animals move," he said. "These movements are not limited by intellect. "The perfect example is to see a child playing on a playground, or running around a forest -- this is how humankind used to be originally -- genuine and excited. These movements evoke a desire to follow." Provocative performer Polunin performed on state television throughout the 1970s and 1980s, using his wordless routines to mock the authorities without falling foul of draconian censorship. "During Soviet times, when Brezhnev was still in power and there was no freedom of speech and expression, I came up with idea of movements without any words to express your personality," he said. The art of clowning is filled with fantasy and absurdity Slava Polunin "This idea became massively popular, because I was saying important things without actually saying them." Polunin became one of the country's best known clowns, later creating the "Academy of Fools," an international organization uniting clowns, and the "Caravan of the World," a traveling theater that meandered from Red Square in Moscow to Paris's Tuileries Gardens. Universal language Of course, not every country has the same sense of humor, and Polunin must alter his shows depending on where in the world he's performing. Americans prefer a faster pace. The Spanish more passion. The French more poetry. And the British seem quite happy for him to stand still for 10 seconds or more. "I feel very happy when I discover something new on stage," said Polunin. "For example, you perform in China and realize that everything you have done in Europe does not work with a Chinese audience. "So you start searching, improvising and suddenly you hear a laughter. You wonder why this laughter happened, so you start to dig into those movements. Every culture has its own aspects of movement." Polunin seems determined to explore them all.
